## Instructions

1. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

2. **Combine Wet Ingredients**: In another bowl, whisk together buttermilk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract.

3. **Make the Batter**: Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Don't overmix - lumps are okay!

4. **Let it Rest**: Let the batter rest for 5 minutes while your griddle heats up.

5. **Cook**: Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter. Pour 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake.

6. **Flip**: Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes more.

7. **Serve**: Stack 'em high and serve immediately with maple syrup, fresh berries, and a pat of butter.

## Tips

- Don't overmix the batter! A few lumps are perfectly fine and will result in fluffier pancakes.
- Let the batter rest for 5 minutes before cooking for extra fluffy results.
- Keep finished pancakes warm in a 200°F oven while you cook the rest of the batch.
- For extra special pancakes, add chocolate chips, blueberries, or banana slices to the batter.

## Variations

- **Blueberry Pancakes**: Fold 1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries into the batter.
- **Chocolate Chip**: Add 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the batter.
- **Banana**: Mash 1 ripe banana and mix into the wet ingredients.
- **Whole Wheat**: Replace half the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour.
