## Instructions

1. **Preheat**: Preheat oven to 375°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. **Dry Ingredients**: Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.

3. **Cream Butter**: Beat butter and both sugars until fluffy, about 3 minutes.

4. **Add Eggs**: Beat in eggs one at a time, then vanilla.

5. **Combine**: Gradually mix in dry ingredients. Fold in chocolate chips.

6. **Bake**: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto prepared sheets. Bake 10-12 minutes until golden.

7. **Cool**: Let cool on pan for 5 minutes before transferring to wire rack.

## Tips

- Don't overbake! Remove when edges are golden but centers look slightly underdone.
- Chill dough for 30 minutes for thicker cookies.
- Use a mix of milk and dark chocolate chips for depth of flavor.
