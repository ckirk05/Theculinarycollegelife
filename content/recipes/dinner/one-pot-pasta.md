## Instructions

1. **Start the Base**: Heat olive oil in a large pot, sauté garlic for 30 seconds.

2. **Add Everything**: Add pasta, broth, tomatoes, zucchini, and bell pepper. Bring to a boil.

3. **Cook**: Reduce heat and simmer for 12-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until pasta is cooked and liquid is mostly absorbed.

4. **Finish**: Stir in heavy cream and parmesan. Season with salt and pepper.

5. **Garnish**: Top with fresh basil and serve immediately.

## Tips

- Stir frequently to prevent pasta from sticking.
- Add more broth if pasta seems dry.
- Customize with your favorite vegetables.
