## Instructions

1. **Preheat**: Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper.

2. **Make Marinade**: Mix olive oil, lemon juice and zest, garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper.

3. **Prep Chicken**: Place chicken on one side of the pan, brush with half the marinade.

4. **Add Vegetables**: Arrange potatoes, broccoli, and carrots on the other side. Toss with remaining marinade.

5. **Roast**: Bake for 30-35 minutes until chicken reaches 165°F and vegetables are tender.

6. **Rest and Serve**: Let chicken rest 5 minutes before slicing. Serve with roasted vegetables.

## Tips

- Cut vegetables uniformly for even cooking.
- Use a meat thermometer to ensure chicken is cooked through.
- Add vegetables halfway through if they cook faster than chicken.
