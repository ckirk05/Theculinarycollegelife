## Why I Started Meal Prepping

Between classes, studying, and trying to have a social life, cooking every single day just wasn't happening. I was spending way too much on takeout and eating way too much ramen.

Enter: Meal Prep Sunday.

## My Sunday Routine

### 1. Planning (15 minutes)

Every Saturday night, I look at my week ahead and plan:
- How many meals do I need?
- What ingredients do I already have?
- What's on sale at the grocery store?

I aim for:
- 5 lunches
- 3-4 dinners (I usually eat out once or twice)
- Breakfast components (overnight oats, hard-boiled eggs)

### 2. Shopping (30 minutes)

Sunday morning, I hit the grocery store with a list. Having a list = no impulse buys = staying on budget.

**My weekly budget**: $40-50 for one person

### 3. The Cooking Marathon (2 hours)

Here's where the magic happens. I batch cook everything at once:

**First 30 minutes:** Prep work
- Wash and chop all vegetables
- Start rice cooker
- Marinate proteins
- Set out all containers

**Next hour:** Cook everything
- Roast vegetables in the oven (sheet pan is my BFF)
- Cook proteins (usually 2-3 types)
- Make a big batch of grains
- Prep breakfast items

**Final 30 minutes:** Assembly and cleanup
- Portion everything into containers
- Label with dates
- Clean kitchen
- Pat myself on the back

## My Go-To Meal Prep Combos

**Combo 1:** Grilled chicken + roasted veggies + quinoa

**Combo 2:** Taco bowls (seasoned ground turkey, rice, beans, salsa, cheese)

**Combo 3:** Asian-inspired (teriyaki chicken, broccoli, rice)

**Breakfast:** Overnight oats (4-5 jars) + hard-boiled eggs

## The Results

- **Time saved**: I'm not scrambling to figure out lunch between classes
- **Money saved**: Eating out 2x/week instead of 10x/week = ~$120/month saved
- **Stress reduced**: One less thing to worry about during busy weeks
- **Health improved**: I'm actually eating vegetables!

## My Best Tips

1. **Start small** - Don't try to prep every meal. Start with just lunches.

2. **Invest in good containers** - I use glass containers. They last forever and reheat well.

3. **Keep it simple** - You don't need fancy recipes. Protein + veggie + grain = perfect.

4. **Make it fun** - Put on music or a podcast. Pour a drink. Make it your Sunday ritual.

5. **Don't aim for perfection** - Some weeks I prep 3 meals, some weeks 6. That's okay!

## Is It For Everyone?

Honestly? No. Some people love cooking fresh every day. But if you're:
- Busy
- On a budget
- Trying to eat healthier
- Tired of deciding what to eat

Then give meal prep a shot. Just one Sunday. See how it feels.
