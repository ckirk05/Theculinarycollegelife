## The Challenge

$40 per week for all groceries. That's my reality, and honestly? It's doable. Here's exactly how I do it.

## My Weekly Shopping List

### Proteins ($12)
- Chicken thighs (cheaper than breasts!)
- Eggs (a dozen)
- Canned beans
- Sometimes: ground turkey on sale

### Produce ($10)
- 1 head of lettuce or spinach
- Tomatoes
- Bananas (breakfast)
- 1-2 seasonal vegetables (whatever's on sale)
- Onions and garlic (last forever)

### Grains & Carbs ($8)
- Rice or pasta
- Oats
- Bread (I get the store brand)

### Dairy ($6)
- Milk or milk alternative
- Yogurt
- Cheese (one block lasts 2 weeks)

### Extras ($4)
- Peanut butter
- Canned tomatoes
- One "treat" item

## My Money-Saving Strategies

### 1. Shop Store Brands
The ingredients are literally the same. I save $10-15/week just by grabbing the store brand instead of name brand.

### 2. Buy What's On Sale
I build my meals around what's on sale that week. Chicken on sale? That's my protein. Ground beef marked down? Taco night it is.

### 3. Avoid Pre-Cut Everything
Those pre-cut vegetables? You're paying for convenience. I spend 10 extra minutes chopping and save $5.

### 4. Shop the Perimeter
Whole ingredients around the edges = cheaper and healthier than processed stuff in the middle aisles.

### 5. Check Unit Prices
That "family size" isn't always cheaper! I always check the unit price (price per ounce) on the shelf label.

### 6. Buy in Bulk (Smartly)
Rice, beans, oats - buy the big bags. They last forever and you'll save. But don't bulk buy fresh produce unless you have a plan for it all.

### 7. Use a List
I make a list and STICK TO IT. No impulse buys. That bag of chips can wait.

### 8. Shop After Eating
Never shop hungry. Ever. Made that mistake once and spent $75 on snacks.

## What I DON'T Buy

- Soda and juice (water is free!)
- Frozen dinners (expensive per serving)
- Individual snack packs
- Out-of-season produce
- "Superfoods" (regular fruits and veggies are fine!)

## Sample Week of Meals ($40 Budget)

**Breakfasts**: Oatmeal or eggs with toast
**Lunches**: Chicken and rice bowls with veggies
**Dinners**: Pasta with marinara and vegetables, bean tacos, stir-fry
**Snacks**: Peanut butter and banana, yogurt, cheese and crackers

Not fancy, but nutritious and filling!

## My Biggest Lessons

1. **Cooking from scratch is SO much cheaper** than any convenience food
2. **Boring is okay** - I eat similar meals most weeks
3. **Splurge wisely** - I save my "eating out" budget for social occasions
4. **It gets easier** - After a few weeks, you know what's a good price

## The Reality Check

Am I eating gourmet meals every night? Nope. Do I sometimes wish I could order pizza? Absolutely. But am I eating healthy, filling meals while staying in budget? Yes!

And honestly, learning to cook on a budget is a skill that'll last way beyond college.
