## Let's Talk About Failures

Instagram makes cooking look perfect. But real talk? I've burned, oversalted, and completely ruined more meals than I can count. Here are my biggest mistakes and what I learned.

## Mistake #1: Not Reading the Recipe First

**What happened**: I started making cookies, got halfway through, and realized I didn't have baking soda. Tried to substitute with baking powder. They turned out flat and weird.

**The lesson**: Read the ENTIRE recipe before starting. Check you have all ingredients. Understand the steps. Future you will be grateful.

**Pro tip**: I now do a "mise en place" - fancy French term for "get all your stuff ready." I measure everything into little bowls before I start cooking. Game changer.

## Mistake #2: Cooking Everything on High Heat

**What happened**: Burned garlic. Burned onions. Somehow burned a grilled cheese on the outside while leaving it cold inside. My smoke detector and I became very familiar.

**The lesson**: High heat is rarely the answer. Medium heat gives you time to actually cook things through without burning the outside.

**When to use high heat**: Boiling water, searing meat. That's about it.

## Mistake #3: Over-Crowding the Pan

**What happened**: Tried to cook a whole bag of chicken pieces in one pan. Instead of getting that nice golden color, everything just steamed and turned gray and sad.

**The lesson**: Give your food space! Overcrowding = steaming instead of searing. Cook in batches if you need to.

This especially matters for: roasted vegetables, sautéed mushrooms, searing meat.

## Mistake #4: Not Tasting as I Cook

**What happened**: Made a big pot of soup, didn't taste it until the end. It was SO bland. Added a ton of salt to compensate. Now it's too salty. Can't un-salt it.

**The lesson**: Taste constantly! Season gradually! You can always add more, but you can't take it back.

**My new rule**: Taste after every major step. Adjust seasoning. Taste again.

## Mistake #5: Giving Up After Failures

**What happened**: My first attempt at homemade pizza was a complete disaster. Dough didn't rise, toppings were soggy, whole thing stuck to the pan. I was ready to give up and just order Dominos forever.

**The lesson**: Everyone messes up. Professional chefs mess up. The difference is they keep trying.

**What I did**: Tried again a week later with a different recipe. Better! Still not perfect, but edible. Third time? Actually pretty good! Now pizza night is my favorite thing to make.

## Bonus Mistakes

Quick-fire round of other things I learned the hard way:

- **Use a timer** - "I'll remember" = I will definitely forget and burn it
- **Dried herbs ≠ fresh herbs** - They're not 1:1 substitutes
- **Meat needs to rest** - Cut into it immediately = all the juices run out
- **Sharp knives are safer** - Dull knives slip and that's how you cut yourself
- **Water + hot oil = chaos** - Dry your food before adding to hot oil

## The Point

You're going to mess up. I still mess up. Last week I forgot I was boiling eggs and they exploded in the pot. It happens!

The kitchen is for learning. Every mistake teaches you something. Every burned dinner makes you better at the next one.

So try that recipe. If it fails, laugh it off, order pizza, and try again next week.
