## Starting Your Kitchen Journey

When I moved into my first apartment, I had no idea what I actually needed in the kitchen. After a year of trial and error (and some wasted money), here are the true essentials.

## The Must-Have Tools

### 1. **Chef's Knife**
One good knife beats a whole set of cheap ones. Invest in a quality 8-inch chef's knife - it'll last you through college and beyond.

### 2. **Cutting Board**
Get a large plastic cutting board that's dishwasher safe. Your countertops will thank you.

### 3. **Large Pot & Skillet**
A 4-quart pot for pasta and soups, and a 10-12 inch skillet for everything else. These two will handle 90% of your cooking.

### 4. **Sheet Pan**
Perfect for roasting vegetables, baking cookies, and those amazing sheet pan dinners.

### 5. **Mixing Bowls**
A set of 3 (small, medium, large) will cover all your needs.

## Pantry Staples

### 6. **Olive Oil**
Your cooking workhorse for sautéing, roasting, and dressings.

### 7. **Salt, Pepper, and Basic Spices**
Start with these: salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and Italian seasoning. Build from there.

### 8. **Rice and Pasta**
Cheap, versatile, and filling. Keep both on hand.

### 9. **Canned Beans and Tomatoes**
Quick protein and the base for countless meals.

### 10. **Eggs**
Breakfast, lunch, dinner - eggs do it all and they're budget-friendly.

## My Shopping Strategy

I spent about $100 initially on tools and another $50 on pantry staples. It sounds like a lot, but it lasts! Compare that to eating out every day.

**Pro tip**: Check if your parents have extras they can give you. My mom sent me home with half my kitchen supplies.

## What You DON'T Need

- Fancy appliances (wait on the Instant Pot until you know you'll use it)
- Full knife sets
- Specialized tools (garlic press, avocado slicer, etc.)
- Matching dish sets

Keep it simple, focus on the basics, and add more as you discover what you actually use.
